# Policies Affecting Your Research Data

Data you create may be affected by a more than one Research Data policy (government, funding body, or university). The terms of these polices will determine what your and the University's rights and responsibilities are over your data.

* For advice on Research Data policies, please contact [Research & Enterprise Services](http://research.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

Examples of Research Data policies include:

1. The *draft* [University of Lincoln Research Data Management Policy](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/rdm-policy):
    * *"This policy sets out the university's expectations for the management of research data across all academic disciplines and in all forms."*
	
	* It is not currently a formal policy of the University, but we expect it to be adopted in 2013

	* [Other universities](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/policy-and-legal/institutional-data-policies/uk-institutional-data-policies) have similar policies

2. The Research Councils UK (RCUK) [Common Principles on Data Policy](http://lncn.eu/bqz3):
    * *"Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property."*

3. Individual [research funders' policies](http://lncn.eu/cz46):
    * Most research funding bodies now have a Research Data policy which affects data created by research they fund
	
	* Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://lncn.eu/cz46) by the Digital Curation Centre
	
	* Policies vary from funder to funder, but tend to cover the following:
        * **Timeframes** for describing your data and/or making it accessible
		
		* **Data planning** at the grant application stage and throughout the life of the data
		
		* **Access** to data through [OA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) publishing, data repositories, data sharing or reuse
		
		* **Long-term curation**, preservation and maintenance of your data
		
	* The Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) requires *institutions* (not individual researchers) to develop a '[roadmap](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/standards/researchdata/Pages/policyframework.aspx)' for research data management - the University of Lincoln submitted its EPSRC roadmap in April 2012
