# <i class="icon-wrench"></i> Research Tools

The University of Lincoln wishes to support researchers by providing you with appropriate software tools in order to undertake your research. We recognise that each research discipline will have specialist tools appropriate to its own needs.

However, there are a number of applications which will be of general use during the planning, research, and publication stages of your work, irrespective of research discipline. This page provides access to a number of such tools which are recommended (in some cases <em>required</em>) by the University of Lincoln.

## <i class="icon-check"></i> Before You Start
		
<p>Before you start working on a research project, even before you submit a bid for funding, you should consider how you're going to manage your research data. We recommend taking a look at the following tools and resources to help you understand and plan your project.</p>

<div class="row">

	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Awards Management System</h4>
		
		<p>If you are applying for funding for your project, you are required to use the University's Awards Management System (AMS) to construct, record and budget the details of your project. For unfunded projects, use of the AMS is not required.</p>
		
		<p><a class="btn" href="https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/"><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Go to the AMS</a></p>

		<h4>Research Data Training</h4>
		
		<p>The following suite of training materials provides an overview of research data management concepts and practices, links to useful external resources, and specific information on using data tools & services at Lincoln. Workshops are offered to academic staff through the HR training programme.</p>

		<h4>Data Management Planning (DMP)</h4>
		
		<p>Research funders increasingly expect grant-holders to develop and implement Data Management Plans (DMPs). The <em>DMPOnline</em> tool helps you build and edit your data management plan in line with the requirements of major UK funders.</p>

		<h4>Blogs</h2>
		
		<p>The University's Blogs system is the best place for you to record what you're working on, be that in the form of a traditional 'journal-like' blog, a website explaining what you're doing, a private lab notebook or more. You can give other members of your research team the ability to add, edit and approve content as well, and there's even a social network built in to let you discuss things.</p>

		<h4>Git <small>(Coming Soon)</small></h4>
		
		<p>Git is a source management system which lets you track changes to your code, documents or other resources over time. You can step backwards to previous versions with ease, see exactly who made a change, and even clone and merge resources as team members work on different things.</p>

		<h4>CKAN <small>Alpha</small></h4>
		
		<p>CKAN is being provided as part of the Orbital project to catalogue and archive your research data. Once your data is in CKAN it's easily citable by others, as well as being made more visible.</p>

		<h2><i class="icon-folder-open"></i> When You're Done</h2>
		
		<p>Research data management doesn't end when your project is finished, with research councils increasingly demanding long-term preservation of information. These tools make sure that what you've achieved doesn't get lost, as well as improving the visibility of your work.</p>
