# <i class="icon-wrench"></i> Research Tools

The University of Lincoln wishes to support researchers by providing you with appropriate software tools in order to undertake your research. We recognise that each research discipline will have specialist tools appropriate to its own needs.

However, there are a number of applications which will be of general use during the planning, research, and publication stages of your work, irrespective of research discipline. This page provides access to a number of such tools which are recommended (in some cases <em>required</em>) by the University of Lincoln.

## <i class="icon-check"></i> Before You Start
		
<p>Before you start working on a research project, even before you submit a bid for funding, you should consider how you're going to manage your research data. We recommend taking a look at the following tools and resources to help you understand and plan your project.</p>

<div class="row">

	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Awards Management System</h4>
		
		<p>If you are applying for funding for your project, you are required to use the University's Awards Management System (AMS) to construct, record and budget the details of your project. For unfunded projects, use of the AMS is not required.</p>
		
		<p><a class="btn" href="https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/"><i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Go to the AMS</a></p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Research data training</h4>
		
		<p>The following suite of training materials provides an overview of research data management concepts and practices, links to useful external resources, and specific information on using data tools & services at Lincoln. Workshops are offered to staff through the HR training programme.</p>

	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Data Management Planning (DMP)</h4>
		
		<p>Research funders increasingly expect grant-holders to develop and implement Data Management Plans (DMPs). The <em>DMPOnline</em> tool helps you build and edit your data management plan in line with the requirements of major UK funders.</p>

		<h2><i class="icon-pencil"></i> During Your Research</h2>
		
		<p>Throughout your research project you will be expected to store and describe/document your research data appropriately and safely, as well as record your research findings. These tools help you to keep your work safe and organised.</p>

		<h4>Researcher Dashboard</h4>
		
		<p>By <a href="https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/signin?destination=https%3A%2F%2Forbital.lincoln.ac.uk%2F">signing in</a> to this site, you can see an overview of your research activity at the University of Lincoln, including funded projects recorded in the AMS. You can also record details of <em>un</em>funded projects, edit your staff profile and research interests, and see details of publications held in the Lincoln Repository.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="span4">
	
	<h4>CKAN</h4>
		
		<p>CKAN is a platform for managing and publishing data. It can act as an SQL data store, a file repository, and a data catalogue. Once your data is in CKAN you can provide access where appropriate, and it will become easily citable. This access and citation may be required by your research funder.</p>

	</div>
			
	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Blogs</h2>
		
		<p>Blogs are the recommended tool to set up a research project website, be that in the form of a traditional 'journal-like' blog, a website explaining what you're doing, a private lab notebook or more. You can give other members of your research team the ability to add, edit and approve content, and there's even a social network built in to allow discussion of your work.</p>

		<h2><i class="icon-folder-open"></i> When You're Done</h2>
		
		<p>Research data management doesn't end when your project is finished. The Research Councils increasingly demand long-term preservation of information. These tools make sure your work is preserved and disseminated.</p>

		<h4>The Lincoln Repository</h4>
		
		<p>The Lincoln Repository is used to record details of <em>all</em> University research outputs: articles, conference papers, <em>etc.</em>. The University requires all outputs to be recorded here, and the Repository is used to report (internally and externally) on research activity. It also populates your staff profile on the web with a list of your publications. An Open Access (OA) copy of each paper can be deposited for each of your outputs: this helps improve visibility and citation of your work, and is required by all the major research funding bodies.</p>

	<div class="span4">
	
		<h4>Researcher Dashboard</h4>
		
		<p>The Researcher Dashboard can be used to formally deposit and publish your research data for long-term storage and curation. This may be required by your funder. Every dataset deposited in this way will receive a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for permanent citation.</p>
