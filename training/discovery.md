# Data search and discovery tools

There are a number of online tools and services which you can use to find existing datasets available for re-use in your own research. It is important to understand the terms under which data has been published: see the section on licensing.

* For advice on data search and discovery, please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/)

Examples of data discovery tools include:

## British Library: [http://www.bl.uk/datasets](http://www.bl.uk/datasets)

The BL's Research Datasets programme is focused on the challenges of managing ever increasing volumes of data, working towards its long-term preservation, and establishing standards for data citation. Datasets are [searchable](http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?ct=facet&fctN=facet_rtype&fctV=datasets&dscnt=1&scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&frbg=&tab=local_tab&srt=rank&ct=search&mode=Basic&dum=true&tb=t&indx=1&vl(freeText0)=dat*&fn=search&vid=BLVU1) through the BL's "explore" tool, and advice on finding research data is available though their [website](http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/experthelp/science/sciencetechnologymedicinecollections/researchdatasets/datasetdiscovery.html).

## Databib: [http://databib.org/](http://databib.org/)

Databib is a searchable catalog / registry / directory / bibliography of research data repositories. Individual, discipline-specific repositories are categorised by subject area. Databib is hosted by [Purdue University Libraries](http://www.lib.purdue.edu/) in the USA, and maintained by an international board of editors.

## DataCite Metadata Search: [http://search.datacite.org/ui](http://search.datacite.org/ui)

DataCite is a not-for-profit organisation whose aim is to establish easier access to research data on the Internet. DataCite runs a service allowing data publishers to register metadata and mint [DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)](http://www.doi.org/) for their datasets; this [metadata registry is publicly searchable](http://search.datacite.org/ui).

## Figshare: [http://figshare.com/](http://figshare.com/)

Figshare is a free, personal, social web service which allows researchers to publish all of their research outputs in seconds in an easily citable, sharable and discoverable manner. All data is persistently stored online under the most liberal Creative Commons licence. All research made publicly available gets allocated a DataCite DOI at point of publication, and figshare provides a tool for browsing and searching across all data stored within it.

## Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data): [http://www.re3data.org/search/](http://www.re3data.org/search/)

re3data.org is nother global registry of research data repositories, maintained by the [German Research Foundation)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Forschungsgemeinschaft} (*Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft*) and a number of research libraries and institutions in Germany. The registry uses icons to identify important characteristics of each data repository: access and licence conditions, technical standards, *etc.*

## UK Data Archive: [http://data-archive.ac.uk/](http://data-archive.ac.uk/)

The UK's largest collection of digital research data in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Based at the [University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk/), the UK Data Archive now includes the [Economic and Social Data Service](http://www.esds.ac.uk/) which hosts key national and international survey data and qualitative data.

Advice on re-using existing data is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/training/train-trainer/disciplinary-rdm-training/access-use-and-reuse/access-use-and-reuse).
