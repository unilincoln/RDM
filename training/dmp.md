# Data Management Planning (DMP)

Research funders increasingly expect grant-holders to develop and implement Data Management Plans (DMPs), both at the grant application stage, and throughout the life of their research project. DMPs usually cover:

* What data will be created, how much, and what for
* The nature of the data to be created, including any special conditions (*e.g.* sensitive data)
* How it will be initially gathered and stored
* Any restrictions that will need to be applied
* How long the data will need to be retained, and what will happen to it after that period
* Whether the data is to be published, and under what conditions
* *etc.*

DMPs are a useful tool to help you and your University (Research & Enterprise; the Library; ICT Services) understand your data needs and requirements. More advice on policies and policy tools is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans).

#### Funders' requirements for Data Management Plans

* Most of the major public research funders will require you to create a DMP at the grant application stage. Funders' policies on DMP have been [summarised](http://lncn.eu/est3) by the Digital Curation Centre

* The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is unusual in that it does not require a DMP at the grant application stage. However, it *does* expect data to be preserved and shared, so the researcher and the University will still need to do carry out some internal planning to ensure this is done correctly

#### DMPOnline: [https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)

The DMPOnline tool helps you build and edit your Data Management Plan in line with the requirements of major UK funders. The tool also contains helpful guidance and links for researchers and other data professionals.

#### Data Asset Framework (DAF survey): [http://lncn.eu/efj8](http://lncn.eu/efj8)

The DAF survey asks some higher-level questions about your research data. It is designed mainly to aid the University in understanding its researchers' needs, but may also help you to think about the data you are collecting. The survey is based on a questionnaire that has been used across many universities in the UK. Data collected by the survey is primarily for internal use, but anonymised summaries of the data will be published in project reports.
