The following suite of training materials have been developed at the University of Lincoln by the [Orbital project](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) up to March 2013. They provide an overview of research data management concepts and practices, links to useful external resources, and specific information on using data tools & services at Lincoln.
