# Legal and ethical issues

This page provides links to useful information about legal and ethical issues affecting the creation, management, storage, publication, and re-use of research data.

> For advice on ethical and legal issues in research, please contact [Research & Enterprise Services](http://research.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

## University of Lincoln research ethics

The University's *Ethical Principles for Conducting Research with Humans and Other Animals*, along with the latest version of the Research Misconduct Policy, which outlines expectations of good practice in research, are available on the [University Portal](https://portal.lincoln.ac.uk/C11/C8/ResearchEthicsPolicy/default.aspx), alongside links to external documents about general research ethics.

## UK Data Archive guidance

The [UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/) maintain a set of web pages which provide a useful overview of ethical and legal obligations in Research Data Management, covering ethical guidelines for research involving people, an overview of legislation affecting research data, and guidance for Research Ethics Committees (RECs).

## Freedom of Information (FoI) legislation and research data

The relationship between research data and the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) can be complex. You should seek specialist advice from the [Registrar's Executive Officer and Information Compliance Manager](http://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/home?q=Information%20Compliance).

In 2010, the [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/) published advice to researchers concerned about requests for their research data under either Freedom of Information legislation, or Environmental Information Regulations, all of which came into force in 2005. The publication can be downloaded from: [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/foiresearchdata](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/foiresearchdata)

The ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) published its own advice on FoI legislation in 2011, aimed specifically at public authorities in the higher education sector. [This advice can be downloaded from the ICO's website](http://www.ico.org.uk/news/latest_news/2011/ico-issues-advice-on-the-disclosure-of-research-information-26092011).

In July 2012, following Parliamentary scrutiny of the potentially negative effects of FoI requests on academic research, the UK Government agreed to amend the FoIA to help address universities' concerns (see paragraphs 213-214 of the [Select Committee publication](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmjust/96/9610.htm#a47)).

This amendment was reported in the '[Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/422049.article)' in December.
