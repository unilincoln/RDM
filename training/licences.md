# Licences for sharing your data

All research data that you share or publish should have an appropriate licence applied. This makes it clear to third parties what they are entitled to do with your data, and how you must be cited / credited for its re-use. Releasing data without explicit terms of use can lead to confusion and is counter-productive: confusingly- or poorly-licenced data is less likely to be used to further new research. More advice on licensing is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data).

## General advice

You can only apply a licence to your data if you have the right to do so in the first place - if you are the **rights holder** (or if the rights holder has granted you the right to licence data on their behalf). This means that it is important to resolve any Intellectual Property (IP) questions or concerns before you share / publish any data.

Before you release data under a licence, you should find out whether you are obliged or encouraged to use a certain licence as a [condition of funding or of local policy](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies), or as a result of your choice of [data publishing tool](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies).

Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://lncn.eu/cz46) by the Digital Curation Centre.

## Types of licences

### Creative Commons (CC): [http://creativecommons.org/](http://creativecommons.org/)

### Open Data Commons: [http://opendatacommons.org/](http://opendatacommons.org/)

### Open Government Licence: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/)

### Bespoke licences

Writing a bespoke licence for your data is not a trivial undertaking, and almost certainly unnecessary in the light of the standard licences available (see ‘Standard licences’ below). Furthermore, using a standard licence helps the users of your data, as it reduces the number of licences they have to work with and aids interoperability. There are circumstances, though, in which it might be worth writing a custom licence: where the data have significant commercial value,[19] or where you need to clarify your responsibilities and those of reusers in respect of the data.

If you decide to do this, in the first instance you should consult with your organisation’s research office, commercialisation services team and/or legal department.

## How to license your data

As well as the legal text, the licences all have quick clear summaries and a canonical URL for use in HTML, RDF and other code. A rights expression language is also --- machine readable

There are six main Creative Commons licences
