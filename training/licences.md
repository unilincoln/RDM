# Licences for sharing your data

All research data that you share or publish should have an appropriate licence applied. This makes it clear to third parties what they are entitled to do with your data, and how you must be cited / credited for its re-use. Releasing data without explicit terms of use can lead to confusion and is counter-productive: confusingly- or poorly-licenced data is less likely to be used to further new research. More advice on licensing is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data).

> For advice on licences, Intellectual Property (IP) and your data, please contact [Research & Enterprise Services](http://research.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

## General advice

You can only apply a licence to your data if you have the right to do so in the first place - if you are the **rights holder** (or if the rights holder has granted you the right to licence data on their behalf). This means that it is important to resolve any Intellectual Property (IP) questions or concerns before you share / publish any data.

Before you release data under a licence, you should find out whether you are obliged or encouraged to use a certain licence as a [condition of funding or of local policy](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies), or as a result of your choice of [data publishing tool](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies).

Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://lncn.eu/cz46) by the Digital Curation Centre.

## Types of licences

### 1. Creative Commons: [http://creativecommons.org/](http://creativecommons.org/)

Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization based in California. CC licences are a very popular method for authors, artists, and educators to license their work. All CC licences have quick, readable summaries in addition to the formal legal text. Each has a canonical URL (location on the Internet) and a reference to a CC licence can be included in a document in a machine-readable way.

There are **six** main Creative Commons licences, all of which require **attribution** - *i.e.* that the person using your content cites / attributes you as the original creator of the work. (In addition to the six main licences there is also a ["CC0" (Creative Commons Zero)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence for work dedicated entirely into the public domain: this would not normally be used for research data.)

### Open Data Commons: [http://opendatacommons.org/](http://opendatacommons.org/)

Open Data Commons (ODC) licences were developed in 2007 as an alternative to Creative Commons. The ODC licences share much of the character of CC licences, but are written in terms that may be better suited to licensing research data. Unlike CC, Open Data Commons licences are specific about how the original creator should be cited / use of their data attributed.

### Bespoke licences

Writing a bespoke licence for your data is not a trivial undertaking, and almost certainly unnecessary in the light of the standard licences available (see ‘Standard licences’ below). Furthermore, using a standard licence helps the users of your data, as it reduces the number of licences they have to work with and aids interoperability. There are circumstances, though, in which it might be worth writing a custom licence: where the data have significant commercial value,[19] or where you need to clarify your responsibilities and those of reusers in respect of the data.

If you decide to do this, in the first instance you should consult with your organisation’s research office, commercialisation services team and/or legal department.
