# Licences for sharing your data

All research data that you share or publish should have an appropriate licence applied. This makes it clear to third parties what they are entitled to do with your data, and how you must be cited / credited for its re-use. Releasing data without explicit terms of use can lead to confusion and is counter-productive: confusingly- or poorly-licenced data is less likely to be used to further new research. More advice on licensing is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data).

### General advice

* You can only apply a licence to your data if you have the right to do so in the first place - if you are the **rights holder** (or if the rights holder has granted you the right to licence data on their behalf). This means that it is important to resolve any Intellectual Property (IP) questions or concerns before you share / publish any data.

> For advice on Intellectual Property (IP) and your data, please contact [Research & Enterprise Services](http://research.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/).

Before considering the licensing options that are available, you should first check whether you are obliged or strongly encouraged to use a certain licence as a condition of funding or deposit, or as a matter of local policy.

 The default legal position on how data may be used in any given context is hard to untangle, not least because different jurisdictions apply different standards of creativity, skill, labour and expense when judging whether copyright or similar rights pertain. The situation is complicated by the fact that different aspects of a database – field values (i.e. the data themselves), field names, the structure and data model for the database, data entry interfaces, visualisations and reports derived from the data – may be treated quite differently.[8]
