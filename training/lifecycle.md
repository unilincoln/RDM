# The research data lifecycle

The [research data lifecycle](http://data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle) diagram (below) is a useful reminder of the stages involved in working with research data throughout its life.

> For general advice on working with research data, please [see the help section](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-help).

Some of the stages involved in research data management (creation, processing, analysis) are wholly the domain of researchers and research groups in the Colleges. Other stages (planning, preservation, storage, publication/citation) are supported by departments of the University (Research & Enterprise Development, the Library, ICT Services).
