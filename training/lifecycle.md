# The research data lifecycle

The research data lifecycle diagrams (below) are a useful reminder of the stages involved in working with research data throughout its life.

> For general advice on working with research data, please [see the help section](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-help).

Some of the stages involved in research data management (creation, processing, analysis) are wholly the domain of researchers and research groups in the Colleges. In the other stages (planning, preservation, storage, publication/citation), you can request support from [various departments of the University](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-help) (Research & Enterprise Development, the Library, ICT Services).

## DCC curation lifecycle model

It may also be useful for researchers to understand the broader data curation issues faced by universities. This model, produced by the UK's [Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/) (DCC), provides a graphical, high-level overview stages required for successful curation and preservation of data from initial conceptualisation or receipt through the iterative curation cycle.
