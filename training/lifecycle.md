# The research data lifecycle

The [research data lifecycle](http://data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle) diagram (below) is a useful reminder of the stages involved in working with research data throughout its life.

Some of the stages involved in research data management (creation, processing, analysis) are wholly the domain of researchers and research groups in the Colleges. Others (planning, preservation, storage, publication/citation) are supported by departments of the University (Research & Enterprise Development, the Library, ICT Services).
