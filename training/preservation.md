# Data curation and preservation

The Researcher Dashboard can be used to formally deposit and publish your research data for long-term storage and curation in the [Lincoln Repository](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/). This may be [required by your funder](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies). Every dataset deposited in this way will receive a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) for permanent citation.
