# Data publishing and citation

This page contains advice and guidance on publishing your research data, on making it openly accessible for re-use under licence, and on how you can ensure it is cited correctly. There are a number of benefits to making research data publicly accessible, and many research funders now mandate it.

> For advice on data publishing and citation, please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/), or email [eprints@lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:eprints@lincoln.ac.uk)

## Research funders' requirements

Complex requirements of the major public research funders (covering publications, metadata about your data, and the data itself):

Most research funding bodies now have Research Data policies which oblige reseachers to provide some level of public access to data arising from research projects they have funded. You should read your funding agreement carefully so that you are clear about your obligations. Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/policy-and-legal/overview-funders-data-policies) by the Digital Curation Centre.

> *"A significant number of research funders now require that data produced in the course of the research they fund should be made available for other researchers to discover, examine and build upon. The rationale given by UK funders is that opening up the data allows for new knowledge to be discovered through comparative studies, data mining and so on; it also allows greater scrutiny of how research conclusions have been reached, potentially driving up research quality. Some journals are taking a similar stance, requiring that authors deposit their supporting data either with the journal itself or with a recognised data repository."*

## Benefits to sharing/publishing

There are many additional reasons why releasing/publishing data can be in a researcher's interests:

1. Supports research integrity and verification of results; improves research governance and integrity; reduces fraud
2. Enables and stimulates re-use of data both within and across discipline boundaries, enabling new interdisciplinary data-driven research
3. Allows researchers to extract further value from existing data
4. Discipline of openness encourages clear and unambiguous practice (data must be well-documented before it can be released!)
5. Re-use of data increases citations and evidence of impact (possible impact measure in future REF exercises)
6. Increases efficiency of research by reducing both data collection costs and the possibility of duplication
7. Makes research support more efficient through cost savings and better use of researchers' time
8. "[Student as Producer](http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk/)": while it may be unreasonable to expect students to collect and analyse primary data in short courses, open research data allows students to work on genuine, existing research problems

## Legislation

In some circumstances, research data may be subject to requests under Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation. The relationship between research data and the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) can be complex. You should seek specialist advice from the [Registrar's Executive Officer and Information Compliance Manager](http://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/home?q=Information%20Compliance).

## Licensing

All research data that you share or publish should have an appropriate licence applied. This makes it clear to third parties what they are entitled to do with your data, and how you must be cited / credited for its re-use. Releasing data without explicit terms of use can lead to confusion and is counter-productive: poorly-licenced data is less likely to be used to further new research. See also: [Licences for sharing your data](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-licences).

## Citing data and data identifiers

As is standard academic practice, you will usually be obliged and expected to cite/reference any data that you re-use.

The Researcher Dashboard can be used to formally deposit and publish your own research data for long-term storage and curation in the [Lincoln Repository](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/). Every dataset deposited in this way will receive a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) for permanent citation. More advice on data citation and linking is [available from the Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/briefing-papers/introduction-curation/data-citation-and-linking).

## Tools for publishing research data

The University of Lincoln provides two main platforms which can help you to share and publish research data: [CKAN](http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/) and the [Lincoln Repository](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/). Alternatively it may be more appropriate for you to host and publish your data using a third-party system.

### CKAN: [http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/)

CKAN is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) data cataloguing software application, written and maintained by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) and piloted for use as a research data storage and manipluation tool in 2012-2013 by the [Orbital project](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) at the University of Lincoln.

You can use CKAN:

* to describe and record the existence of your research datasets (metadata)
* to store and manipulate the data itself
* to share access to your data with people inside and outside the University of Lincoln.

Using the "[My Projects](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/projects)" section of the Researcher Dashboard, you can automatically generate datasets for projects held in the University's [Awards Management System (AMS)](https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/).

###  The Lincoln Repository: [http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/)

The Lincoln Repository is used to record details of *all* University research outputs: articles, conference papers, *etc.* The University requires all outputs to be recorded here, and the Repository is used to report (internally and externally) on research activity. It also populates your staff profile on the web with a list of your publications. An Open Access (OA) copy of each paper can be deposited for each of your outputs: this helps improve visibility and citation of your work, and is required by all the major research funding bodies.

The Researcher Dashboard can be used to formally deposit and publish your research data for long-term storage and curation in the [Lincoln Repository](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/). This may be [required by your funder](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies). Every dataset deposited in this way will receive a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) for permanent citation.

### Other data publishing platforms

Depending on your discipline, the nature of your research, and the type of data you hold, it may be more appropriate for you to host and publish your data using a third-party system. Please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/) for advice.

Many [data search and discovery tools](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-discovery) double-up as data publishing platforms. A [Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-dmp) can help you understand the best place to host and publish your data.
