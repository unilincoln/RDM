# Data publishing and citation

This page contains advice and guidance on publishing your research data, on making it openly accessible for re-use under licence, and on how you can ensure it is cited correctly. There are a number of benefits to making research data publicly accessible, and many research funders now mandate it.

> For advice on data publishing and citation, please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/), or email [eprints@lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:eprints@lincoln.ac.uk)

### Research funders' requirements

Complex requirements of the major public research funders (covering publications, metadata about your data, and the data itself): http://lncn.eu/cz46

### Benefits to sharing/publishing

* Supports research integrity and verification
* Discovery and collaboration, new uses
* Increased citations and evidence of impact

### Citing data and data identifiers

### Tools for publishing research data

The University of Lincoln provides two main tools which

#### CKAN: [http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/)

CKAN is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) data cataloguing software application, written and maintained by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) and piloted for use as a research data storage and manipluation tool in 2012-2013 by the [Orbital project](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) at the University of Lincoln.

You can use CKAN:

* to describe and record the existence of your research datasets (metadata)
* to store and manipulate the data itself
* to share access to your data with people inside and outside the University of Lincoln.

Using the "[My Projects](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/projects)" section of the Researcher Dashboard, you can automatically generate datasets for projects held in the University's [Awards Management System (AMS)](https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about CKAN is available in this help guide. -->

####  The Lincoln Repository: [http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about the Lincoln Repository is available in this help guide. -->

Depending on your discipline, the nature of your research, and the type of data you hold, it may be more appropriate for you to host and publish your data using a third-party system. Please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/) for advice. A [Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-dmp) can help you understand the best place to host and publish your data.
