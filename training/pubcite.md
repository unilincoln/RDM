# Data publishing and citation

This page contains advice and guidance on publishing your research data, on making it openly accessible for re-use under licence, and on how you can ensure it is cited correctly. There are a number of benefits to making research data publicly accessible, and many research funders now mandate it.

> For advice on data publishing and citation, please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/), or email [eprints@lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:eprints@lincoln.ac.uk)

## Research funders' requirements

Complex requirements of the major public research funders (covering publications, metadata about your data, and the data itself):

Most research funding bodies now have Research Data policies which oblige reseachers to provide some level of public access to data arising from research projects they have funded. You should read your funding agreement carefully so that you are clear about your obligations. Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/policy-and-legal/overview-funders-data-policies) by the Digital Curation Centre.

> *"A significant number of research funders now require that data produced in the course of the research they fund should be made available for other researchers to discover, examine and build upon. The rationale given by UK funders is that opening up the data allows for new knowledge to be discovered through comparative studies, data mining and so on; it also allows greater scrutiny of how research conclusions have been reached, potentially driving up research quality. Some journals are taking a similar stance, requiring that authors deposit their supporting data either with the journal itself or with a recognised data repository."*

## Benefits to sharing/publishing

* Supports research integrity and verification
* Discovery and collaboration, new uses
* Increased citations and evidence of impact



There are many additional reasons why releasing data can be in a researcher’s interests.[3],[4] The discipline of working up data for eventual release helps in ensuring that a full and clear record is preserved of how the conclusions were reached from the data, protecting the researcher from potential challenges. A culture of openness deters fraud, encourages learning from mistakes as well as from successes, and breaks down barriers to interdisciplinary and ‘citizen science’ research. The availability of the data, alongside associated tools and protocols, increases the efficiency of research by reducing both data collection costs and the possibility of duplication. It also has the potential to increase the impact of the research, not only academically,[5] but also economically and socially.

There may also be circumstances in which researchers find themselves obliged to release data. It is possible that research data held by a UK university may be the subject of a request made under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FoIA), the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, or their Scottish counterparts and therefore have to be released, even if findings based on the data have not yet been published.[6] This is true even if data were generated and are owned by a third party, such as a university in another country. There are provisions within the FoIA for exempting information that has already been scheduled for release at the time a request is made, implying that it may be possible to avoid the premature release of research data by adopting a policy for releasing it.[7]

Merely releasing data without making clear their terms of use can be somewhat counter-productive, though. The default legal position on how data may be used in any given context is hard to untangle, not least because different jurisdictions apply different standards of creativity, skill, labour and expense when judging whether copyright or similar rights pertain. The situation is complicated by the fact that different aspects of a database – field values (i.e. the data themselves), field names, the structure and data model for the database, data entry interfaces, visualisations and reports derived from the data – may be treated quite differently.[8]

## Tools for publishing research data

The University of Lincoln provides two main tools which

### CKAN: [http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/)

CKAN is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) data cataloguing software application, written and maintained by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) and piloted for use as a research data storage and manipluation tool in 2012-2013 by the [Orbital project](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) at the University of Lincoln.

You can use CKAN:

* to describe and record the existence of your research datasets (metadata)
* to store and manipulate the data itself
* to share access to your data with people inside and outside the University of Lincoln.

Using the "[My Projects](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/projects)" section of the Researcher Dashboard, you can automatically generate datasets for projects held in the University's [Awards Management System (AMS)](https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about CKAN is available in this help guide. -->

###  The Lincoln Repository: [http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about the Lincoln Repository is available in this help guide. -->

Depending on your discipline, the nature of your research, and the type of data you hold, it may be more appropriate for you to host and publish your data using a third-party system. Please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/) for advice. A [Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-dmp) can help you understand the best place to host and publish your data.
