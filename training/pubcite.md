# Data publishing and citation

This page contains advice and guidance on publishing your research data, on making it openly accessible for re-use under licence, and on how you can ensure it is cited correctly. There are a number of benefits to making research data publicly accessible, and many research funders now mandate it.

> For advice on data publishing and citation, please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/), or email [eprints@lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:eprints@lincoln.ac.uk)

## Research funders' requirements

Complex requirements of the major public research funders (covering publications, metadata about your data, and the data itself):

Most research funding bodies now have Research Data policies which oblige reseachers to provide some level of public access to data arising from research projects they have funded. You should read your funding agreement carefully so that you are clear about your obligations. Funders' policies have been [summarised in a table](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/policy-and-legal/overview-funders-data-policies) by the Digital Curation Centre.

> *"A significant number of research funders now require that data produced in the course of the research they fund should be made available for other researchers to discover, examine and build upon. The rationale given by UK funders is that opening up the data allows for new knowledge to be discovered through comparative studies, data mining and so on; it also allows greater scrutiny of how research conclusions have been reached, potentially driving up research quality. Some journals are taking a similar stance, requiring that authors deposit their supporting data either with the journal itself or with a recognised data repository."*

## Benefits to sharing/publishing

There are many additional reasons why releasing data can be in a researcher’s interests.

* Supports research integrity and verification
* Discipline of openness encourages clear and unambiguous practice
* Discovery and collaboration, new uses
* Increased citations and evidence of impact


* culture of openness deters fraud, encourages learning from mistakes as well as from successes, and breaks down barriers to interdisciplinary and ‘citizen science’ research (DCC)
* availability of the data, alongside associated tools and protocols, increases the efficiency of research by reducing both data collection costs and the possibility of duplication (DCC)
* potential to increase the impact of the research, not only academically, but also economically and socially

* Improves research effectiveness: Faster information/data access [reduced latency], support for data publication & citation, new research/research funding, data training materials, improved research tools. Less time spent managing data, more time for research, producing more value.
Builds capacity for supporting larger research projects.					
* Research support efficiencies: Cost savings such as increased service productivity or data re-use, freeing up researchers from support tasks e.g. back-up, re-use of data management plans.
Improvements to quality of bids, potential for increased grant income.
* Student as Producer: Unreasonable to expect students to collect and analyse primary data in short courses. Allows students to work on genuine, existing research problems. Direct examples of good science.
* Metrics and Business Intelligence: Improves the research Information lifecycle and offers improved metrics for researchers and the institution.
* Improves research governance and integrity.
* Integrated research information environment (AMS/RDM/ePrints/Staff
profiles/Metrics)
* Technology Innovation: Enhanced research tools. Better datasets, improved methodologies, etc.Improved support for Œacademic computing¹.
* Mitigates risk: Increases security of data; reduces liability.
* Stimulates collaboration between researchers internally and externally. Opportunities for multi- disciplinary research.
* Better dissemination: Enables/increases citation of research data (possible impact measure in future REF).
* Greater opportunity for creating further value from data through re-use.
* Improves IPR oversight and management.

## Legislation

In some circumstances, research data may be subject to requests under Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation. The relationship between research data and the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) can be complex. You should seek specialist advice from the [Registrar's Executive Officer and Information Compliance Manager](http://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/home?q=Information%20Compliance).

## Licensing

Merely releasing data without making clear their terms of use can be somewhat counter-productive, though. The default legal position on how data may be used in any given context is hard to untangle, not least because different jurisdictions apply different standards of creativity, skill, labour and expense when judging whether copyright or similar rights pertain. The situation is complicated by the fact that different aspects of a database – field values (i.e. the data themselves), field names, the structure and data model for the database, data entry interfaces, visualisations and reports derived from the data – may be treated quite differently.[8]

## Tools for publishing research data

The University of Lincoln provides two main tools which

### CKAN: [http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://ckan.lincoln.ac.uk/)

CKAN is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software) data cataloguing software application, written and maintained by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) and piloted for use as a research data storage and manipluation tool in 2012-2013 by the [Orbital project](http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/) at the University of Lincoln.

You can use CKAN:

* to describe and record the existence of your research datasets (metadata)
* to store and manipulate the data itself
* to share access to your data with people inside and outside the University of Lincoln.

Using the "[My Projects](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/projects)" section of the Researcher Dashboard, you can automatically generate datasets for projects held in the University's [Awards Management System (AMS)](https://ams.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about CKAN is available in this help guide. -->

###  The Lincoln Repository: [http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/)

<!--- More information about the Lincoln Repository is available in this help guide. -->

Depending on your discipline, the nature of your research, and the type of data you hold, it may be more appropriate for you to host and publish your data using a third-party system. Please contact [your Academic Subject Librarian](http://library.lincoln.ac.uk/home/learning-development/academic-subject-librarians/contact-your-academic-subject-librarian/) for advice. A [Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-dmp) can help you understand the best place to host and publish your data.
