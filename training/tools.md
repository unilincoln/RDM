# Tools for working with your data

Each research discipline will have specialist software tools appropriate to its own needs. For general Research Data Management activities, a number of tools are provided and recommended (in some cases, *required*) by the University of Lincoln.

> For assistance with software formats and tools for working with your data, please contact [ICT Services](http://support.lincoln.ac.uk/).

A list of tools is [available on this page](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/researchtools).
