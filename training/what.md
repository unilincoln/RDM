# What Is Research Data?
* Research data is "that which is collected, observed, or created ~~in a digital form~~, for purposes of analysing to produce original research results" ([University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/services/research-support/data-library/data-repository/definitions))
* Irrespective of subject (*i.e.* not just the "hard sciences")
* Irrespective of collection method, form of research, or format:
    *   Textual, numerical, multimedia, structured (XML, databases), software code, proprietary software formats ([University of So'ton](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/338816/))
