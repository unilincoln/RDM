# What is research data?

When we talk about research "data", we are not referring only to quantitative, tabular, "hard-scientific" data.

According to [this definition from the University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/services/research-support/data-library/data-repository/definitions), research data is **anything** *"...collected, observed, or created in a digital form, for purposes of analysing to produce original research results."*

Research data, according to this wider definition:

1. May be produced by and for any subject (*i.e.* not just the "hard sciences")

2. Applies irrespective of collection method, form of research, or format:
    * Textual, numerical, multimedia, structured (XML, databases), software code, proprietary software formats ([University of So'ton](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/338816/))
