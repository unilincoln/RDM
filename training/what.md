# What do we mean by research data?

When we talk about research "data", we are **not** just referring to quantitative, tabular, hard-scientific data. Research data is anything *"collected, observed, or created ~~in a digital form~~, for purposes of analysing to produce original research results"* ([University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/services/research-support/data-library/data-repository/definitions)).

This definition of research data:

* Refers to data produced by and for any subject (*i.e.* not just the "hard sciences")

* Applies irrespective of collection method, form of research, or format:
    * Textual, numerical, multimedia, structured (XML, databases), software code, proprietary software formats ([University of So'ton](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/338816/))
