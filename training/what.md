# What is research data?

This page provides links to useful, practical definitions of research data, and examples of the types of material that are commonly understood as research data.

> For general advice on working with research data, please [see the help section](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-help).

When we talk about research 'data', we are not *only* referring to quantitative, tabular, 'hard-scientific' data, but to any material which is required to revalidate the results of research. The [University of Lincoln Research Data Management Policy](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/rdm-policy) does not specify any limited definition of research data: individual researchers are best placed to ensure that they meet the [expectations of their funders](https://orbital.lincoln.ac.uk/training-policies) and their research communities.

## University of Edinburgh definition

According to [this definition from the University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/information-services/services/research-support/data-library/data-repository/definitions), research data is **anything** *"...collected, observed, or created in a digital form, for purposes of analysing to produce original research results."*

Research data, according to this wider definition:

1. May be produced by and for any subject (*i.e.* not just the 'hard sciences')

2. Applies irrespective of collection method, form of research, or format:
    * Textual, numerical, multimedia, structured (XML, databases), software code, proprietary software formats ([University of So'ton](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/338816/))
    
## Australian National Data Service guide

This guide from the [ANDS](http://ands.org.au/) is intended for people in universities and other research institutions needing a definition of research data. It includes links to individual (australian) universities' definitions of research data, gives examples of what research data is *not*, and suggests researchers should ask themselves the question: *'what needs to be kept to validate the results of research?'*.

The guide can be found at: [http://ands.org.au/guides/what-is-research-data.html](http://ands.org.au/guides/what-is-research-data.html)

## University of Southampton guide

This guide from the [University of Southampton](http://www.soton.ac.uk/) - aimed at PhD students -  introduces the forms data can take by showing five ways of looking at data, then presents some case studies of data usage in several disciplines in an attempt to illustrate the types of data you might encounter in your research.
