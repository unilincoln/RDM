# Workshops and training events

As part of the [Orbital project](http://blogs.library.lincoln.ac.uk/), we are starting to offer introductory training to (initially) postgraduate students, on how to look after their research data. This will shortly be extended to academic staff through the HR training programme.

Research data management is an important part of the research process, and a vital part of academic practice. These 90-minute workshops will include a presentation and discussion of what you should consider when creating, looking after, and sharing/publishing your research data.

Postgraduate students can book a place on a workshop, online at:  [http://uolresearchdata.eventbrite.co.uk/](http://uolresearchdata.eventbrite.co.uk/)

The workshops cover:

* What do we mean by research data?
* Policies affecting your data
* Data Management Planning (DMP)
* The research data lifecycle
* Practical tools for looking after your data
* Data publishing and citation
* Where to go for help
